If I were to start a software company I'd want my partners to be trustworthy, coordinative, passionate and form a synergy with our similar vision and goals. I would want them to be the one to turn to when I'm in a difficult situation. 
I would want them to be competitive to deliver an idealistic result. My partners skills should compiment and differ from mine which when bought together delivers the best result. These qualities best describes two of my friends from my batch.
I am good at Technical Skills such as Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Web Development and Python. I need a person who is good at management and a person who is good at Innovative thinking and Problem Solving. One is Soumith Varma and the other P Pooja. 
Soumith is one of the most passionate person I've met, he is responsible, have leadership quality, calm under pressure and I think he is best suited for operations and managerial role of the company where he can be decisive and use his ideas for leading and managing the team. 
Pooja is creative and innovative. She would be the ideal person for designing and providing unique ideas with new functionalities of the product. She could present the planning and designing phase of the software to be developed.
